# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Re-solved a problem from Pramp interview: findLargestSmallerKey. Object is to find the largest value in a binary tree that is smaller than a given number. I didn't really get it during the interview, was helpful to try to solve it on my own again.

**Thoughts:** This has been a useful introduction to Binary Search Trees and their traversal. This problem highlighted my need to brush up on recursion and has excited me to plow ahead into more data structures (breadth-first search?) and cozy up better with BSTs (depth-first?). Also excited to be back in the 100 Days of Code saddle.
